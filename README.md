# MatrixOOP316

MatrixOOP316 is a quirky C++ console application created for MAI university coursework. It animates a zigzag line that travels from the right side of your console window to the left—then vanishes!  
While it may not solve any world problems, it’s a playful exploration of console graphics, object-oriented programming, and creative code.

## 🚀 Features

- **Animated Zigzag Line**: Watch a line move in a zigzag pattern across your console.
- **Object-Oriented Design**: The project is built with C++ (97%) and a touch of C (3%), showing off OOP concepts in a simple setting.
- **Educational Value**: Great for learning about console manipulation, loops, and basic animation in C++.
